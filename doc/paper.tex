\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}
	
	The problem of symbolic regression (SR)~\cite{billard2002symbolic} has attracted many researchers over the last decade to study it intensively. SR can be seen as a generalization of the well known  concept of linear regression, i.e., polynomial regression~\cite{stimson1978interpreting}. All regression models in principle have the same task: given a set of a $n$-dimensional input data and the output data, the aim is to find a  mathematical expression (function) consisting of $n$ (input) variables that fits to the output data w.r.t. some in advance known measure.  This computationally intensive task is in general NP--hard~\cite{virgolin2022symbolic}. When aiming a model to be a linear combination of input variables, it represents the problem of linear regression. However, when there are some nonlinear relations between variables, which are relevant, linear regression models are not enough. This is the point where symbolic regression comes into the play. Unlike linear regression, it allows the search over the space of all possible mathematical formulas in order to find the best fitting ones able to  predict the output variable from the input variables. The base of constructing the explicit formula are the basis operations like addition and multiplication, as well as polynomial, trigonometric, exponential, and other elementary functions.

	 Concrete examples of application of SR include having a less black--box tool, as it may say much more how SR model achieve predictions, that is the coefficients and functions that build the model may indicate on larger importance of some variables over the others. Moreover, in that way we may grasp why the variables are related in the obtained way. As an example, appearance of an exponential function may associate  to  some physical phenomenon such as intensity of radiation or acceleration over time, see~\cite{udrescu2020ai}. Additionally, the SR models, if they are correct, may have    posses  larger extrapolation power than other mathematical models, and especially than neural network--based methods. SR models may maximize obtaining physically more reasonable equations that could serve as insight towards  establishing  physical theory behind as the final goal.  Practical applications of SR in chemical and biological sciences are listed in~\cite{weng2020simple}. In particular,  the discovery of a series of new oxide perovskite catalysts with improved activities is presented there. Applications of SR to discovering physical laws from distorted video is studied in~\cite{udrescu2021symbolic} by means of a unsupervised learning method. Revealing complex ecological dynamics by SR is presented in~\cite{chen2019revealing}, tackled by  a machine learning method. Application of SR to model the mutations effects on protein  stability, in the domain of fundamental and applied biology,  is shown in~\cite{louis2021reviewing}. One of the recent work studies of  auto-discovering conserved quantities using trajectory data from unknown dynamical systems, where SR is solved by a machine learning algorithm, see~\cite{liu2021machine}. Last but not least, we mention the paper~\cite{liang2019phillips} discovers  the application of  SR to model analytic representations of the exciton binding energy. The use of solving the SR in material science is described in~\cite{wang2019symbolic,wang2022symbolic,burlacu2022symbolic,kabliman2021application}. 
	 
	 
	 
	 There are many different ways to tackle the SR by achieving the right analytic expressions, most of them are related to machine learning techniques or to the technique of genetic programming (GP) and various approximate methods, such as meta-heuristics. Among the first GP methods to tackle SR is the one of Raidl~\cite{raidl1998hybrid} based on a hybrid variant of genetic programming. A differential evolution algorithm was proposed by Cerny et al.~\cite{cerny2008using}. Age-fitness Pareto Optimization approach is proposed by Smidt and Lipson~\cite{schmidt2010age}.  
	 Application of local--based heuristics on solving SR is discusses by Commenda in his Ph.D. thesis~\cite{kommenda2018local}. A  GP-based approach, the gene-pool optimal mixing evolutionary algorithm (GOMEA) is studied by Virgolin et al.~\cite{virgolin2021improving}.  Another evolutionary algorithm, the interaction-transformation EA (ITEA) has been proposed by de Franca et al.~\cite{de2021interaction}. Simulated annealing to solve SR is proposed by Kantor~\cite{kantor2021simulated}. A Variable neighborhood search GP--based approach to solve SR  is proposed by Elleurich et al.~\cite{elleuch2020variable}.  
	 Kommenda et al.~\cite{kommenda2020parameter} proposed a method called OPERON algorithm, which uses nonlinear least squares for parameter identification of SR models further integrated into a local search mechanism in
	 tree-based GP. The C++ implementation of OPERON is discussed in~\cite{burlacu2020operon}. The method that uses Taylor polynomial to approximate the symbolic equation that fits the dataset, called Taylor genetic programming, is proposed in~\cite{he2022taylor}. A GP approach that uses the idea of semantic back-propagation (SBP-GP) is proposed in~\cite{virgolin2019linear}.   Empirical analysis of variance between many GP--based methods for SR is discussed in~\cite{kammerer2021empirical}. It is also worth to mention the GP--based Eurequa commercial solver~\cite{schmidt2009distilling, schmidt2011machine} that uses age-fitness pareto optimization  with co-evolved fitness estimation. This solver is nowadays accepted for the gold standard of symbolic regression.   
	 
	 
	 Machine learning--based method   based on Bayesian symbolic regression (BSR) is proposed in~\cite{jin2019bayesian},  belongs to the family of Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms. Deep Symbolic Regression (DSR), a RNN approach, is proposed in~\cite{petersen2019deep} utilizing the policy gradient search. This mechanism of search is further investigated in~\cite{landajuela2021improving}. A fast neural network approach, called OccamNet,  is proposed in~\cite{costa2020fast}.  A deep reinforcement learning approach enhanced with genetic programming is given in~\cite{mundhenk2021symbolic}. 
	
	Powerful hybrid techniques to solve SR are also well studied; among them, we emphasize the EPLEX solver from~\cite{la2019probabilistic,la2016epsilon} and AI Feynman algorithm from~\cite{udrescu2020ai}, a physics-inspired divide-and-conquer method that  combines neural network
	fitting. The later one is one of the most efficient method for physically inspired models. We also mention the Fast Function Extraction (FFX) algorithm developed by McConaghy~\cite{mcconaghy2011ffx}, which is a non-evolutionary technique in combination with a machine learning technique --- pathwise regularized learning -- which is in charge to quickly prune a huge set of candidate basis functions down to compact models.

\subsection{Contributions of this work}

The main contributions of this work can be summarized as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item The proposed method outperforms all state-of-the-art methods for ground-truth problems from literature, considered in the SRBench benchmark. 
	
	\item It shows high robustness, which is proved by testing methods under different levels of Gaussian white noise. 
	
	\item The method is very efficient, taking in average around xyz seconds to reach exact solution -- when exact solution is found. 
	
	\item The new set of unbiased instances is introduced -- randomly generated formula of various sizes. All the other methods were tested against this new test-bed. The proposed RILS-ROLS method showed to be dominant here as well.
